Perfect. I’ll analyze the SVS event scoring for Thursday and Friday alongside your Enigma and Silverfrost token inventories and store options, to identify the best-value redemptions for maximizing SVS points—while also balancing rare item conservation and power growth.

I’ll return a table showing point-per-token values across relevant rewards from both stores, highlighting optimal choices based on your current resources and limits.

# Maximizing SVS Points (Thursday & Friday) with Enigma and Silverfrost Tokens

To get the most **points per token** during the last two days of the SvS (State of Power) event, we should focus on the event tasks for **Thursday (Hero Development)** and **Friday (Power Boost)** and see which purchasable items convert into the highest SVS points. Below is a comparison of relevant items from the **Silverfrost** and **Enigma** event shops, including their token costs, the SVS points you gain by using them in the event tasks, and the **points-per-token** efficiency. We’ll also note if an item is particularly **valuable** for your long-term progression (meaning you might not want to spend it solely for points unless necessary).

## Points per Token Comparison Table

| **Item (Event Shop)**                               | **Token Cost** | **SVS Points per Item**                                      | **Points per Token** (Efficiency) | **Notes**                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mithril** (Silverfrost)                           | 40 per 1       | **144,000** points per Mithril (Hero Dev/Power Boost task)¹  | **3,600** pts/token (highest)     | Huge points; use first.                                      |
| **1h Speedup** – General (Enigma)                   | 1 per 1h       | **1,800** points per 1h used for build/research/training²    | **1,800** pts/token               | Great for any category.                                      |
| **1h Speedup** – Research/Training (Silverfrost)    | 10 per 8h      | **8 × 1h = 14,400** points per 8h used (at 30 pts/min)       | **1,440** pts/token               | Use if more speedups needed after Enigma’s.                  |
| **Fire Crystal** – Bulk Pack (Silverfrost)          | 30 per 20      | **20 × 2,000 = 40,000** points if all 20 used for building   | **1,333** pts/token               | One-time purchase (limit 1); great value.                    |
| **Hero Gear Essence Stones** – Pack (Silverfrost)   | 120 per 36     | **36 × 4,000 = 144,000** points if all used                  | **1,200** pts/token               | One-time purchase (limit 1); good value.                     |
| **Fire Crystal** – Small Pack (Silverfrost)         | 10 per 6       | **6 × 2,000 = 12,000** points for 6 crystals                 | **1,200** pts/token               | Repeatable; use after bulk pack.                             |
| **Hero Gear Essence Stones** – Small (Silverfrost)  | 50 per 13      | **13 × 4,000 = 52,000** points if used                       | **1,040** pts/token               | Repeatable; decent if you need more.                         |
| **Fire Crystal** (Enigma)                           | 2 per 1        | **2,000** points per crystal used for building               | **1,000** pts/token               | Fallback if Silverfrost crystals exhausted.                  |
| **Advanced Wild Mark** (Enigma)                     | 20 per 1       | **15,000** points per mark used on pets                      | **750** pts/token                 | Big points each, but costly and **rare** – use sparingly.    |
| **Custom Mythic Hero Gear** (Silverfrost)           | 250 per 1 gear | ~**233,000** points (approx.) if crafted/equipped³           | **~932** pts/token                | **Very rare** item; huge power boost but moderate efficiency. |
| **Random Hero Gear Chest** (Silverfrost)            | 50 per 1 chest | **8,000** points (if it counts as one Widget use) + gear score gains⁴ | **~160** pts/token (base)         | **Luck-based** gear; not efficient just for points.          |
| **Pet Food / Material Chests** (Enigma/Silverfrost) | 5–10 per pack  | **Variable** (via pet *score* increases at 50 pts per score) | **Low** (est. <<500 pts/token)    | Use existing stock first; token buy not efficient for points. |

**Table Notes:**

1. *Mithril:* In the general SVS rules, using 1 Mithril gives 40,000 points. Your event appears to list **144,000** points each, which is even better – if that figure is correct in your game, Mithril yields an **enormous** 3,600 pts/token (by far the best). Either way, Mithril is the top priority for scoring.
2. *Speedups:* Any 1 minute of speedups used for Construction, Research, or Training grants 30 points. So 60 minutes (1 hour) = 1,800 points. Enigma’s general speedups can be applied to any of those categories, making them very flexible for scoring.
3. *Custom Mythic Gear:* Equipping a new Mythic hero gear piece can count as using a “Widget” (8,000 points) and will **raise your Chief Gear score** significantly. A fresh Mythic gear gives about +6,250 gear score, translating to ~225,000 points (6,250 × 36) from the “gear score” task. Combined ~233k points (≈932 pts/token). This is a **high-value item for power**; consider only if you want the gear itself, since purely for points it’s less efficient than cheaper items.
4. *Random Gear Chest:* If opening it yields a hero gear piece, that should count as **using one Widget** (8,000 points). The gear’s addition might also raise your gear score (points vary by gear quality). However, since the result is random (could be lower-grade gear) and costs 50 tokens per chest, the **points per token** is low. Not recommended solely for points unless you specifically need gear.

## Recommendations for Token Spending (Thursday & Friday)

Given the above efficiencies, here’s how to **maximize your SVS points** while also being mindful of valuable resources:

- **Use What You Already Own First:** Before spending tokens, leverage your current inventory for free points:
  - **Mithril:** If you have any on hand (you listed 0 owned, so likely not). If you acquire Mithril via other means, use it – it’s extremely high scoring (144k each in your event).
  - **Hero Gear Essence Stones:** You have **67** already. Use them on Thursday (Hero Development day) for a quick **268,000 points** (67 × 4,000) without spending any tokens.
  - **Hero Exclusive Gear “Widgets”:** If you have any gear pieces ready to craft or equip (e.g. from previous chests or rewards), using even one will net **8,000 points**. Don’t spend tokens just to get these, but do utilize any you can craft with existing materials.
  - **Fire Crystals:** You own **190** – that’s **380,000 points** if you use them all on building upgrades (Friday). Even using a portion of these can hit milestones; spend tokens on crystals only if you somehow need more after using your stash.
  - **Advanced Wild Marks:** You appear to have **50** (from the Silverfrost data). Each is **15,000 points** on Pet Day (Friday). **These are very rare** pet items, so use them judiciously – but if you need a massive point boost and can spare some, they give a total of 750k points for all 50 (with no token cost). Even a few marks will significantly raise your score.
  - **Common Wild Marks:** If you have a pile from hunting beasts, you can use them for 1,150 points each on Friday. They’re lower impact, but since they’re common, dump any extras for points once higher-value options are exhausted.
  - **Pet Food/Materials:** With **70k+ Pet Food** and some Material Chests on hand, you can level up your pets for *Power Boost* points (50 points per “advancement score”). This tends to yield low points per resource, so use them only if you’re short of other options or if you want the pet progress anyway. For example, raising a pet’s level or skill might increase its BR (battle rating) by, say, 100 points – that’s 100 × 50 = 5,000 event points. It’s something, but not nearly as efficient as items above.
- **Priority Buys with Silverfrost Tokens:**
  1. **Mithril (40 tokens each):** This is your best **bang-for-buck**. If you have enough Silverfrost tokens, buy as many Mithril as you can (up to 25). Spread their usage across Thursday and Friday to score on both days – e.g. use some on Hero Dev day and the rest on Power Boost day, since both count Mithril. Each Mithril gives a whopping 144k points in your event, so a few of these will secure all milestone rewards and push rankings easily. *(If your event Mithril is actually 40k points each, it’s still top priority due to efficiency and total points.)*
  2. **Fire Crystal Pack (30 tokens for 20):** If available, grab this one-time deal. It yields 20 crystals which translate to 40k points on Building Day. Since you already have many crystals, consider this only if you plan a huge building push – but as a one-off purchase, it’s high value (1,333 pts/token).
  3. **Hero Gear Essence Stone Pack (120 tokens for 36):** Another one-time buy with good efficiency (~1,200 pts/token). If you need more points on Thursday after using your 67 stones, this pack can add 144k points. Given you already have some essence stones, buy this only if you require extra to reach a milestone or secure rank.
  4. **Additional Fire Crystals or Essence Stones:** After the packs above, the smaller repeatable options (6 crystals for 10 tokens, or 13 essence stones for 50) have slightly lower efficiency (~1,200 and 1,040 pts/token respectively). These are still decent choices if you have surplus tokens and still need points. Decide based on which day you need points for:
     - If Friday (building) needs a boost, invest in **Fire Crystals**.
     - If Thursday (hero gear upgrades) needs more, invest in **Essence Stones**.
        Both items also contribute to your account growth (building upgrades and gear upgrades), so the tokens won’t be “wasted.”
  5. **Skip/Low Priority (Silverfrost):** *Random Gear Chest* (low efficiency and unpredictable) and *Custom Mythic Gear* (great item but expensive). Only consider the Mythic Gear if you specifically want to improve your hero’s equipment; it’s not an efficient points purchase alone. Also, **do not spend tokens on common speedups in Silverfrost** (like 5-min speeds at 1 token) – these give only 150 points per token, which is extremely poor compared to other options.
- **Priority Buys with Enigma Tokens:**
  1. **1h General Speedups (1 token each, max 25):** Grab all of these. Using them for construction, research, or training will net 1,800 points per token worth. They are cheap and flexible – you can apply them to whatever category you need more points in (e.g. speed training troops on Thursday **and** get troop training points, or rush some building upgrades on Friday). This is a double-dip: for example, speeding troop training yields **both** training points **and** speedup points. These 25 hours (if you have that many tokens) will yield **45,000 points** just from speedup usage, plus additional troop points for Thursday or help finish builds/research for Friday.
  2. **Fire Crystals (2 tokens each):** If you run out of Silverfrost crystals or still need more building points, spend Enigma tokens on Fire Crystals. Each costs 2 tokens for 2,000 points (1000 pts/token). This is a solid fallback once you’ve exhausted better options.
  3. **Advanced Wild Marks (20 tokens each):** These have a relatively **low return (750 pts/token)** and are very scarce. It’s generally **not** worth spending Enigma tokens on these purely for points, **unless** you absolutely need the points and have no other item left. You already have 50 in inventory, so try to use some of those first instead of buying. Only buy more with tokens if you know you’ll use them for pet upgrades later (since any unused would be wasted).
  4. **Skip/Low Priority (Enigma):** Pet Food and Pet Material Chests from the shop are not cost-efficient for points. You have a large stock of pet food already; use that if you want pet points. The **Mythic General Hero Shards** and **Enhancement XP** items do not contribute to the Thursday/Friday tasks (hero shard usage was for earlier days), so don’t spend tokens on those for now.

## Additional Tips

- **Train Troops with Speedups (Thursday):** Since training troops gives points per troop tier and using speedups gives points as well, you can maximize output by training your highest tier troops (T10 for 60 points each) and speeding the training. For example, if you use 1 hour of speedups to finish a batch, you’ll get 1,800 points from the speedups *plus* whatever troop points for those troops. This effectively increases the value of your speedup tokens beyond the 1,800 pts/hr baseline. If you have spare speedups (or tokens to buy more in Silverfrost), consider dumping some into troop training to double-dip on Thursday’s event.
- **Balance Thursday vs Friday:** To **maximize SVS rewards**, try to hit the top milestones on both days. Use the **Hero Development (Thu)** tasks to burn gear items, Mithril, and troop training, and the **Power Boost (Fri)** tasks for pet items, building upgrades, and any remaining resources. You might divide your token spending accordingly – e.g. use some Mithril Thursday and some Friday, rather than all on one day, to secure high rankings on both days.
- **Don’t Overspend Rare Items:** While it’s tempting to throw everything into SVS for points, remember items like **Advanced Wild Marks** and **Mythic gear** are hard to come by. Use just enough to achieve your target (e.g. hitting the final milestone or winning the state vs state competition), but avoid zeroing out these items if you’ll regret it later. **Mithril, Essence Stones, Fire Crystals, and Speedups** are more easily re-obtained through events or packs, so prioritize using/buying those for points.
- **Check Event Limits:** Ensure there’s no cap on how many points you can earn from a category. (For example, sometimes events have a cap on training or building points – from your provided info it looks uncapped, but just be sure.) Also confirm if **144k per Mithril** is indeed the active value – if it is, Mithril uses will blow other methods out of the water. If by chance it’s only 40k each, it’s still great but not so overpowered; you might then complement it with more of the other items.

By following the above strategy, you’ll get the **maximum SVS points per token spent** while also gaining meaningful progress for your account. Focus on the high-return items (Mithril, speedups, Fire Crystals, Essence Stones) to rack up points efficiently, and use your existing stockpiles before buying more. This balanced approach will help you crush the last two days of the event and **maximize your rewards**. Good luck! 🚀

**Sources:** The point values for SVS tasks are referenced from the Whiteout Survival SvS event guide which confirms the scoring for using Hero Gear Essence, Widgets, Mithril, pet items, Fire Crystals, speedups, etc. The recommendations above combine those point values with your provided token shop data to determine the best **points-per-token** options. Always consider your current inventory and future needs when spending valuable event currency. Enjoy the rewards!
